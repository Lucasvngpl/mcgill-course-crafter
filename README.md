# mcgill-course-crafter 🚀​

An intelligent course planning assistant for McGill University students. Ask natural language questions about prerequisites, corequisites, and course sequences — get accurate answers grounded in real catalogue data.

**Live Demo:** [[mcgill-course-crafter.vercel.app](https://mcgill-course-crafter.vercel.app)](https://mcgill-course-crafter.vercel.app/)

## What It Does

McGill's course catalogue is a maze. CourseCraft AI makes it simple:

```
You: "Can I take COMP 273 after taking COMP 206?"

CourseCraft AI: "Yes! COMP 206 is a corequisite for COMP 273, meaning you can 
Take COMP 273 at the same time as COMP 206, or any semester after completing it."
```

The system understands the difference between:
- **Prerequisites** — must complete *before* taking a course
- **Corequisites** — can take *at the same time* or *after* completing

---

## Features

- **Natural Language Q&A** — Ask questions like you'd ask an advisor
- **8,000+ Courses Indexed** — Scraped from McGill's official catalog
- **Hybrid Search** — Combines semantic vector search with deterministic SQL lookups
- **Corequisite-Aware Logic** — Understands nuanced academic rules most systems miss

**Query Flow:**
1. User asks a question
2. Intent classification determines query type
3. Hybrid search retrieves relevant courses (semantic + SQL)
4. Context enrichment adds full course details
5. LLM generates natural language response

## Key Design Decisions

**Why hybrid search?**  
Pure semantic search misses exact matches. Pure SQL can't handle fuzzy queries. Combining both gives the best of both worlds.

**Why separate prereqs and coreqs?**  
Most systems treat them the same. But "COMP 206 is a corequisite" means something different than "COMP 206 is a prerequisite." This distinction matters for accurate advising.

**Why GPT-4o-mini?**  
Fast, cheap, and smart enough for this use case. The RAG pipeline does the heavy lifting — the LLM just needs to synthesize the retrieved context.
